title: An Integral A Day
description: Solving an integral every day for a year!
---

Here is a "project" that I am running to solve an integral every day for the next year. You may be asking, why would I do this? Well the answer is twofold.

1. As a graduate student I am responsible to provide tutoring to undergraduate mathematics students, and integrals are often the hardest thing for new calculus students to solve.
2. There are often times very neat geometric or algebraic tricks for solving integrals, and gaining proficiency in those techniques seems useful!

So here I will set out, starting off my first week with relatively easy integrals and progressing to difficult integrals, and this project page will serve as a landing page documenting this project. There will be associated blog posts for any particularly interesting things I find along the way!
