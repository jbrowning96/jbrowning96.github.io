title: Project Euler
description: A combined math and coding challenge.

From the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) webpage, they state that "Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve."

The further go on to state that computer and programming skills assist is solving these problems, and as I am looking for something to do that is both mathematical and will "hone" some computer science skills along the way, I will be posting my progress in this project page for people to follow, as well as writing up blog posts when a solution I have found is particularly interesting or illuminating.
