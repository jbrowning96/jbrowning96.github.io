Hello and welcome to my portfolio and blog! I am a graduate student at the University of North Texas currently working with [Jackson Morrow](https://sites.google.com/site/jacksonsalvatoremorrow/home?authuser=0).

Currently, I am learning all one can learn about elliptic curves and my primary interests lie in the subfields of number theory and arithmetic geometry. Secondarily I am interested in physical stochastic modelling, with my current projects focusing on climate modelling.

Here you will find links to all of my current projects, my notes, and my ramblings, which all currently serve as a time capsule for my learning journey during graduate school.
