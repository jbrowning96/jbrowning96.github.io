Hello and welcome to my portfolio and blog! I am a graduate student at the University of North Texas. Currently, I am learning about Commutative Algebra, Algebraic Geometry and the arithmetic of Elliptic Curves.

Here you will find links to all of my current projects, my notes, and my ramblings, which all currently serve as a time capsule for my learning journey throughout graduate school. 

Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, you can find a complete CV [here](./resume)
