Hello and welcome to my portfolio and blog! I am a graduate student at the University of North Texas currently working with [Jackson Morrow](https://sites.google.com/site/jacksonsalvatoremorrow/home?authuser=0).

Currently, I am learning all one can learn about elliptic curves and my primary interests lie in the subfields of number theory and arithmetic geometry. Secondarily, I am interested in physical and stochastic modeling.

Here you will find links to all of my current projects, my notes, and my ramblings, which all currently serve as a time capsule for my learning journey throughout graduate school. 

Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, you can find a complete CV [here](./resume)
